Revised Scoring Algorithm Structure
Step 1: Pre-check for Minimum Threshold
Condition: If response length < 10 words (or character count < a threshold, e.g., 50 characters), cap the maximum score.

Rule: Max score = 20 (or any reasonable low cap)

Rationale: Short responses inherently lack depth, context, and coverage.

if word_count < 10:
    return min(calculated_score, 20)
Step 2: Weighted Components (Dynamic Based on Length)
Instead of fixed weights (60/25/15), use adaptive weighting based on the completeness of the response:

Component	Normal Weight	Short Response Weight
Topic Coverage	60%	40%
Factual Accuracy	25%	30%
Depth of Insight	15%	30%

Shorter responses tend to show less depth and topic coverage, so give more weight to accuracy and insight for concise answers.

Step 3: Introduce a Length Factor
Add a length normalization score as a multiplicative factor to penalize excessively short answers.

python

length_score = min(1, word_count / ideal_word_count)
# ideal_word_count might be ~50-100 words depending on the task
final_score = base_score * length_score
Step 4: Bonus for Concise Yet Complete Responses
To avoid punishing users who give excellent short but comprehensive answers:

Add a "concise completeness bonus" if:

All key concepts are hit

No factual errors

Insight is clearly present despite brevity

🔍 Example Logic in Practice
python

def calculate_score(word_count, coverage, accuracy, insight):
    if word_count < 10:
        return min((coverage * 0.4 + accuracy * 0.3 + insight * 0.3), 20)

    base_score = coverage * 0.6 + accuracy * 0.25 + insight * 0.15
    ideal_word_count = 50
    length_factor = min(1.0, word_count / ideal_word_count)
    return base_score * length_factor
✅ Summary of Recommendations
Introduce a word-count gate to cap high scores on low-effort answers.

Adapt weights dynamically based on response length.

Normalize based on ideal response length to reflect completeness.

Reward precision and insight when conciseness is justified.
